  description: 'An automated sandbox deployment platform integrating UI, backend, and CI/CD to spin up demo environments on demand.',
  details: `This internal tooling project enables seamless deployment of isolated environments for product demos:
- A JavaScript-based UI button embedded in a WordPress site triggers the process.
- The button hits an Express.js backend hosted in Docker, which securely handles Jenkins credentials and manages job execution.
- Jenkins pulls, builds, dockerizes, and deploys a Java project to a remote server, returning the live URL.`,
